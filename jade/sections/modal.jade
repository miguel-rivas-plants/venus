				p This was the second project that i worked at Pixel Perfect Tree. When it was giving to me it was an empty frontend with the provided design and a defined <em>.env.sample</em> with a basic configuration of the ports, <em>gitignored</em>, ruby version and some initial gems like <em>haml-rails</em> and <em>autoprefixer</em>.

				p I install the missing gems for <em>bootstrap</em>, <em>rail-sass</em> and proposed to the lead developer a new way to defined metadata for every project. i wasn't sure how to do that in my second project in ruby on rails but i had an idea because i made something similar in <em>Jade</em> for my portfolio and in <em>PHP</em> for Cerveza Presidente. the specifications were a function which gets all the parameters that metadata will need:

				ul
					li Page details
					li Page title
					li Keys for SEO
					li Icons in differents resolutions
					li URL for Open Graph image (Facebook Preview)

				p We agree and started an investigation for that issue them began to deploy a function similar but the parameters were in the translation file (something that was new for me but really handy). After that the project was ready to begin.

				p There were a few things missing in the design that i made and them implemented:

				ul
					li Page 404
					li Facebook Preview
					li Loading

				p This project was a research about basic info of the web, so the user in the end of the lecture can have a nice conversation of multiples topic with people of the area or RRHH. It was something like a community project.

				p At first it was supossed to be a book to be publish in Issuu but i was talking about the web, a book that talk about the web is not that cool as a webpage that talk about the web. this was the first of his kind in my portfolio.

				p This was the first big project that i worked without Backend Developer at Capital DBG.

				p When it was giving to me it was just the provided design, I build the project them the optimization began.

				p The specifications were made the website the fastest that it could because there was a lot of content. I resize all the images to the minimum width/height them optimized and made an special typography with all the icons needed.

				p After that i made individual loaders for every section and organize the info in a way that you will get the firsts sections at the begining then the galley start loading. this way you would see basic content at first while the gallery load.

				p Things that were missing in the design that i made and them implemented:

				p This project was my first including mixing in Jade and CSS 3D transformation (at the beginning this contact form was designed for a bakery store).

				h4 Gear Prototype

				p This project was made based on an analogue clock algorithm, but instead of being calculated between 60 (60 minutes) every point is calculated between 360 making the location of each more precisely.

				h4 Screen Prototype

				p This project was my first with hover only with CSS transitions.
